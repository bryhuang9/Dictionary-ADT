# Dictionary ADT
This project contains the implementation and testing of a Dictionary Abstract Data Type (ADT) with manipulation and access functions. We have used BigInteger to test the functionality of this ADT.

## Files in the Project

### Dictionary.h
This is the header file for the Dictionary class. It includes the function declarations which are implemented in the Dictionary.cpp file.

### Dictionary.cpp
This is the main implementation file of the Dictionary class. It includes the definitions of all the manipulation and access functions for our dictionary, allowing operations such as creation, update, and lookup.

### BigIntegerTest.cpp
This file is used to rigorously test the Dictionary ADT. It makes use of a BigInteger to test all possible operations, ensuring that the Dictionary class works as intended.

### Order.cpp
This file contains a client program for the Dictionary ADT. It's a standalone application that uses the functionality provided by the Dictionary class. It can be used as a reference to understand how to utilize the Dictionary ADT.

### Makefile
This file is used to compile all the .cpp files and create the executable file. It simplifies the build process and helps in maintaining the build environment.

### README.md
You're reading it right now! This file provides an overview of the project structure and the purpose of each file.
